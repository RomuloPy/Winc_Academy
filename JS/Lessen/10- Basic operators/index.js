JS: Basic operators
Below is a small recap of the JavaScript basic operators.

Basic JavaScript Operators
Addition +
Subtraction -
Multiplication *
Division /
Modulus or modulo % (in words: the number you are left with after you divide the two numbers). For example: 18 % 7 = 4.
Why? Because you can divide the number 18 in its entirety by 7 twice. Then you're left with 4.

Increment and Decrement
These two operators don't really fit in the list above, but they are very useful and used often: increment and decrement.

Increment ++
let number = 1; number++; console.log(number); // 2

You type number++ instead of number = number + 1. number = number + 1 is a lot of repetitive typing which most developers don't like that.

Decrement --
let number = 1; number--; console.log(number); // 0

These two don't fit into the list of normal operators because they are not normal expressions. They are statements (just as a variable is not an expression but a statement). With increment and decrement you "re-assign" the variable number by adding or subtracting one to/from it and you return the result of that edit.
